	<description>This mod contains various core functions for other Miscellaneous parts.
It must be loaded before the other parts!

It also comes with the following functions/items:
-Colonist Keys: Place/Group
   This allows you to use the keys 6, 7, 8, 9 to create teams
   The key 0 releases all drafted colonists
   (Note: This needs a new colony to work; the keys can be reconfigured)
-BrainPals
   Some brain implants to enhance your colonists 
   (an idea from 'Old Mans War')

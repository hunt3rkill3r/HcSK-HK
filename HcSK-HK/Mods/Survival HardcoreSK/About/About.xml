  <description>Aligns the balance of HardcoreSK closer to vanilla, designed for players who use the vanilla storytellers such as Cassandra. In general, the survival aspects will be harder to balance a less combat-focused experience that the custom hardcoreSK storytellers provide. This mod folder includes an optional ModsConfig.xml which you may install. It excludes a few of HardcoreSK's modules that are not well balanced into this experience.</description>
